This repository serves as an issue-tracking and suggestion hub for the website. Please read this document first and feel free to submit any issues or suggestions you may have.

## General notes

1. Please use only English for better communication.
2. Try to avoid duplication. Use search to check if a similar issue or suggestion already exists. Also check if the topic has not been discussed in [a similar repository on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/PLTytus/GTAWeb).
3. Please use a template when submitting and provide as much detail as possible.
4. Maintain your culture and treat all participants in the discussion with respect.
5. Stay on topic and keep discussions focused on the subject at hand.
6. Understand that time might be needed to respond and address your feedback. Please be patient and avoid rushing. Programmers are also humans :)
7. I may close an issue if the author does not respond for a longer period, and I cannot duplicate the problem or do not understand the suggestion.

## Security issues

For security issues that should not be shared publicly please use the [Security](https://github.com/PLTytus/GTAWeb/security/advisories/new) tab. Don't worry about technical information fields. If you don't understand them, just leave them blank. I will always ask for the necessary details if they have not been provided and will be needed to solve the problem.

## Translation issues, typos and available languages

There is a separate [translation project at Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gtaweb). Typos, add new language requests, and other translation issues should be reported there. The source language is English. The Polish language has official support. Some languages are partially officially supported by taking some labels directly from the game. Feel free to contribute to the translation project. You can check the list of translators on a special [subpage](https://gtaweb.eu/crowdin).
